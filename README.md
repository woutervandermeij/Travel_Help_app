# Build AI WhatsApp Bots with Pure Python

This guide will walk you through the process of creating a WhatsApp bot using the Meta (formerly Facebook) Cloud API with pure Python, and Flask particular. We'll also integrate webhook events to receive messages in real-time and use OpenAI to generate AI responses. 

## Prerequisites

1. A Meta developer account — If you don’t have one, you can [create a Meta developer account here](https://developers.facebook.com/).
2. A business app — If you don't have one, you can [learn to create a business app here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/development/create-an-app/). If you don't see an option to create a business app, select **Other** > **Next** > **Business**.
